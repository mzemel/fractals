# Fractals

Hello! You may remember me from such tutorials as [Learn to code by sending me your credit card information](https://github.com/mzemel/learn2code).

In the exciting second chapter of this series, I will give you an application able to generate beautiful Mandelbrot fractals from your social security number.

With version 1.1, you'll be able to turn your answers to common security questions into a mnemonic device, making it easier to remember all that personal information!

Stay tuned and enjoy the ride.
